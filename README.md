# Homework 06 - Working with For Loops

## Update Star Rating App

Look at your star rating app from HW05. Would any of your loops be better written as `for` loop? Modify the code to be a for loop.

In your README.md, justify each loop as to why you thought `while` or `for` was the better implementation.
